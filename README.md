After downloading Packet Tracer I started with the brief explanatory intro to the Cisco Packet Tracer interface: <br/>

Once I had a feel for the interface and some of the basics, I advanced to creating a simple network. The first part of the process involved installing a patch panel into the wiring closet and running the necessary straight through copper cables. You can also see the before and after of the rack with optional cable managemnt to clean up the view of the racks: <br/>

<br />
<br />
Once the patch panel was installed I attached a wall mount in the office and connected the necessary cables to the corresponding punchdown connections in the equipment closet and organized the cabling by creating bend points:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Part three involved an additional wall mount and connections from the mount to the corresponding ports on the patch panel. Once the cabling was connected and wrangled, a web browser session was started from the Office-User console and the active connection was verified:  <br/>

I also worked with connecting various devices via wireless LAN and Bluetooth. Here you can see the process of verifying an internet connection on the laptop after connecting to the network with a wireless adapter and confirming DHCP:  <br/>
